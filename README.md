# ChatGPT Voice Integration
This code provides a straightforward approach to integrate voice-based interaction to the ChatGPT web interface. Using the Web Speech API, it allows users to input text via speech and get ChatGPT's responses spoken back.

# Features
Microphone Icon: Adds a clickable microphone icon to the ChatGPT web interface.
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text and inserts them into ChatGPT's input field.
Speech Synthesis: Reads out loud the text responses from ChatGPT.
How it works
addMicrophoneIcon(): This function creates an SVG microphone icon and appends it to the document. Clicking on this icon initiates speech recognition.

startSpeechRecognition(): Responsible for activating the browser's speech recognition and handling the recognized speech. Recognized text is automatically appended to ChatGPT's input field (prompt-textarea). Additionally, it listens for changes in the ChatGPT's response container and triggers the text-to-speech functionality.

speakText(text): Accepts a text string and uses the Web Speech API to read it aloud.

# Usage
Use Inspect console to paste the script
Make sure the ChatGPT's input textarea has the ID prompt-textarea.
Once integrated, you'll find a microphone icon on your interface. Click it and start speaking.
Note
Ensure that your browser supports the Web Speech API. Some features, like the webkitSpeechRecognition, are browser-specific (mostly Chrome). It might be worth adding polyfills or checking for browser compatibility before implementing.

# Potential Enhancements
Styling improvements for the microphone icon.
Error handling for unsupported browsers.
Extend to other languages by modifying the recognition.lang value.
